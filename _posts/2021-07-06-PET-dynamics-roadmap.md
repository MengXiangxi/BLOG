In this post, I am summarizing some materials on dynamic PET imaging, especially the compartment model analysis.

## Book chapters

- **Physics in Nuclear Medicine**, Simon R. Cherry et. al., Sanders, 2012 4th ed.

Chapter 21 of this book, "Tracer Kinetic Modeling", briefly discusses the transportation phenomenon and the compartment models.

- **Basic Sciences of Nuclear Medicine**, edited by Magdy M. Khalil, Springer, 2011.

Chapter 16 of this book, "Tracer Kinetic Modeling: Basics and Concepts", by Kjell Erlandsson from University College of London.

- **Emission Tomography: The Fundamentals of PET and SPECT**, edited by Miles N. Wernick and John N. Aarsvold, Elsevier, 2004.

Chapter 23 of this book, "Kinetic Modeling in Positron Emission Tomography", by E. D. Morris et. al..

- **Positron Emission Tomography: Basic Sciences**, edited by Dale L. Bailey et. al., Springer, 2005.

Chapter 6 of this book, "Tracer Kinetic Modeling in PET", by Richard E. Carson.

## Review Articles

- Hooker, Jacob M., and Richard E. Carson. "Human positron emission tomography neuroimaging." *Annual review of biomedical engineering* 21 (2019): 551-581.

In this review article, the authors summarized comprehensively all aspects of neuroimaging. Part of it discusses modeling in a straightforward way, however, it is based entirely on the reference tissue method.
