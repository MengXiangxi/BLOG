Unlike LaTeX, MS Word lacks the mechanism to input various special symbols. One of the important mechanisms for inserting symbols is via [Dingbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat) fonts such as [Wingdings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/wingdings). These fonts map ASCII characters into glyphs. Another, in my opinion, more reliable way of doing so is by inserting UNICODE symbols.

There are two ways to insert such symbols. First, you can use `Alt`+`X` and edit the **Hexadecimal** code. Alternatively, use can type in the **Decimal** code on the numeric keypad (with NUM LOCK on) while holding the `Alt` key. Detailed explanation can be found on the [Microsoft supporting website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-ascii-or-unicode-latin-based-symbols-and-characters-d13f58d3-7bcb-44a7-a4d5-972ee12e50e0).

However, as for other Microsoft Office components such as PowerPoint and Excel, the Hax code does not work. You can still use the Dec code.

Here is a collection of most used symbols and their encodings.
